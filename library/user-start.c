This module is the runtime start of every user-level program.
The very first symbol in this module must be _start() because
the kernel simply jumps to the very first location of the executable.
_start() sets up any necessary runtime environment and invokes
the main function.  Note that this function cannot exit, but
must invoke the process_exit() system call to terminate the process.
